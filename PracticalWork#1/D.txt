This is the end, beautiful friend
Of our elaborate plans, the end
I'll never look into your eyes, again
Can you picture what will be, so limitless and free
Desperately in need, of some, stranger's hand
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
Get here, and we'll do the rest
The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he came to a door, and he looked inside
Father, yes son, I want to kill you
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
