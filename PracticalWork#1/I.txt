This is the end, my only friend, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
in a, desperate land
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane, all the children are insane
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the snake, ride the snake
The snake is long, seven miles
Ride the snake, he's old, and his skin is cold
The west is the best, the west is the best
The blue bus is callin' us, the blue bus is callin' us
Driver, where you taken us
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and, then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
Doin' a blue rock, on a blue bus
Doin' a blue rock, c'mon, yeah
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
this is the end, my only friend, the end
It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
